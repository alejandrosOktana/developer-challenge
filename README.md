# Developer Challenge

## Running the app
All files necesary to run the page are in the "dist" folder. This files must be serverd by a web server in order to open the page on a browser.

## Live-server instalation
Any static server will work. An easy to use example is the live-server node package.
To install it globally in the machine run the following command:
`npm install -g live-server`

## Serving the page with live-server
After live-server is installed open a terminal in the "dist" folder and run live server with this command:
`live-server`

With the default configuration live-sever makes the page available at http://localhost:8080

## Video sample
A recording of the working app is in the videosample folder

### Notes
- Google chrome responsive view doesn't run range inputs correctly, Chrome mobile on a cell phone works fine
